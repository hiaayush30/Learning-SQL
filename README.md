MySQL and PostgreSQL are both popular relational database management systems (RDBMS), but they have some differences in their commands and syntax. Many basic SQL commands (like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`) are the same across both systems, but there are differences when it comes to more advanced features, data types, and specific SQL functions.

Here are some key differences:

1. **Data Types:**
   - **MySQL:** Uses `TINYINT`, `MEDIUMINT`, `ENUM`, `SET`, etc.
   - **PostgreSQL:** Uses `SERIAL`, `BIGSERIAL`, `BYTEA`, `ARRAY`, `JSON`, etc.

2. **Auto-Increment:**
   - **MySQL:** Uses `AUTO_INCREMENT` to automatically generate unique values.
   - **PostgreSQL:** Uses `SERIAL` or `BIGSERIAL` for auto-incrementing columns.

3. **String Functions:**
   - **MySQL:** Uses `CONCAT()`, `LENGTH()`, `SUBSTRING()`.
   - **PostgreSQL:** Uses `||` for concatenation, `LENGTH()`, `SUBSTRING()`.

4. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - **MySQL:** By default, table names are case-insensitive on Windows and case-sensitive on Unix.
   - **PostgreSQL:** All identifiers (e.g., table names) are case-sensitive by default.

5. **JOIN Syntax:**
   - Both support `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`, but there might be slight differences in performance optimizations.

6. **LIMIT and OFFSET:**
   - **MySQL:** `LIMIT [offset,] row_count`.
   - **PostgreSQL:** `LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset`.

7. **JSON Support:**
   - **MySQL:** Provides JSON support with the `JSON` data type and functions like `JSON_EXTRACT()`.
   - **PostgreSQL:** Has more advanced JSON support with data types `JSON` and `JSONB`, and a wide range of JSON functions.

8. **Full-Text Search:**
   - **MySQL:** Supports full-text search with `MATCH` and `AGAINST` clauses.
   - **PostgreSQL:** Uses the `tsvector` and `tsquery` data types along with functions like `to_tsvector()` and `to_tsquery()`.

9. **CTE (Common Table Expressions):**
   - Both support CTEs, but the implementation details and performance can differ.

10. **Window Functions:**
    - Both support window functions, but PostgreSQL generally has more extensive support.

If you’re working with basic SQL, the commands will be quite similar. However, as you delve into more advanced features, you’ll notice the differences.
